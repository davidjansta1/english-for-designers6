### Thesis

# Storytelling in animated films

### David Jansta

I'm going to talk about my thesis. It's about storytelling in animated films. And we all know, storytelling is kind of important. It's everywhere. Not just in books and films. It's way more frequent than you could think. For example, in sports, commentators are making those games intensive. And these games are itself stories.

There are characters trying to achieve something, struggle, and then achieve it or not. We can find stories almost everywhere. In Pictures, ads, politics, like, I don't know. Stories are just something that is part of a human communication. In prehistory, People were using stories to share knowledge and experience from one generation to the other.

And so I don't have to over explain why are stories kinda essential for good films. Because they are. And how to tell them? We need some good team. That's like, what is the story about? What is the core idea and message you want to tell in your film? 

Another thing that's really important are characters.

We need some protagonist, which is someone we care about and someone that will have to probably go through some struggle. Characters should be believable, so think about its life and everything like its personality, history, looks, etc.

Then there is antagonist, which is a bad guy, someone that has a bad motive and usually is something like a main barrier between protagonist and a happy life. Antagonist doesn't have to be a character, it could also be just a limiting belief of a protagonist. But usually, it's a character.

So, we have some basic theme and characters. And what about where it is? We need some space in time and location where the story took its place.  So, yeah, think about your location. It's essential. 

And now we have basic things. Sure, there are other things that are part of it, but this is just a basic analysis. How to tell the story about these characters? 

We can use simple three arc structure. 

First arc is about setting everything up. Viewer should know where it is, who are the main characters, and what is the problem. Something that is important enough that will lead to a For a character to take action and change something or don't I don't know he doesn't have to try to change it. There just has to be a problem and it should be clear.

Arc 2 could be about many things. Like for example, he could achieve something, meet someone else, someone will help him, someone will betray him, etc.

And then there is the third act, the one when he tries to defeat antagonist. That means he tries to solve the main problem, fulfill his needs, save someone, I don't know.  And this is when the story unfolds. And if it's written well, viewer will get those goosebumps and will think about that movie for the next week. And if that ending is bad. The whole movie could be considered a trash by a lot of people.

And now you can create your own movie.
